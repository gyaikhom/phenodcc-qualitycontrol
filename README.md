# Quality Control Tool

The **PhenoDCC Quality Control Tool** is a web application for
carrying out quality control of phenotype data. It provides an
interactive user interface through which mouse phenotype data can be
visualised, analysed and understood. This tool allows a user to raise
any quality control issues (e.g., data transfer errors) before the
data is archived at the central data archive hosted at
[EMBL-EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/services/teams/impc).
